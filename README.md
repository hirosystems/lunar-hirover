# Lunar Rover Entropy and Address Generator

The purpose of this tool is to:
 1. Generate a single random value that can be [affixed to a lunar rover](https://www.hiro.so/blog/launching-a-bitcoin-treasure-hunt-on-the-moon) and used to generate addresses on a set of [supported chains](#supported-chains).
 2. Display the associated public addresses for the [supported chains](#supported-chains) so that funds can be sent to those addresses.

This tool generates a random entropy value using the [ChaCha20Rng](https://rust-random.github.io/rand/rand_chacha/struct.ChaCha20Rng) Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generator. This is the value that will be affixed to the lunar rover.

This entropy value can be used to generate a 24-word mnemonic phrase, which can be imported into various wallets to generate addresses on that chain. There are a few options for converting the entropy value to a 24-word mnemonic phrase:

*Using Ian Coleman's Mnemonic Code Generator*
 - Go to https://iancoleman.io/bip39/
 - Check the box that says "Show Entropy Details"
 - Paste the entropy value generated by this tool (or that you've found affixed to the lunar rover) into the Entropy field
 - Scroll down to see the mnemonic phrase in the "BIP39 Mnemonic" field
